                        Devoted to delivering the exceptionally best-frozen yogurt and sorbet, ‘Frozen Happiness’ opened in August 2021 at Vaikom .
                        
                        Quite a while later, we moved our retail bistro to a bigger space at  Tripunitra (corner of Private Bus Stand) offering a far-reaching window into an open kitchen, where our solidified sweets are handmade in little clumps, guaranteeing the most astounding quality.<br>
                        
                        We source the world over for kinds of immaculateness and perfection when conceivable sourcing locally and naturally.
                        
                        With a developing rundown of 300 flavors, ‘Frozen Happiness’ brought into the world with the thought, as our name proposes, of being a custom “lab”, where gourmet experts and food providers are urged and invited to work with us to create one of a kind flavors for their individual menus.<br>
                        
                        To our discount customers, we offer weekday conveyance, for nothing out of pocket, and are accessible for counsel on everything solidified. It would be ideal if you don’t hesitate to call to ask for tests, to talk about our items, or to mastermind a tasting in our shop.</p><br>
